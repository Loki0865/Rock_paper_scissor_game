# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game ðŸŽ®

## Overview

Welcome to the **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game, implemented in C++! Challenge yourself against the computer, "Jarvis," and see if you can outsmart the AI in this classic game of chance and strategy.

## Features

- **User vs. AI (Jarvis):** Play against an AI opponent that makes random choices.
- **Draw Handling:** The game allows for repeated plays in case of a draw.
- **Simple and Clear Interface:** Text-based prompts make it easy to play.

## How to Play

The game follows the traditional rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors:
- **Rock beats Scissors**
- **Scissors beat Paper**
- **Paper beats Rock**

## Installation

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Loki0865/Rock_paper_scissor_game.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Rock_paper_scissor_game
   ```

3. **Compile the game:**
   Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed, such as g++. Compile the game using the following command:
   ```bash
   g++ -o rock_paper_scissors main.cpp
   ```

4. **Run the game:**
   After compilation, run the game using:
   ```bash
   ./rock_paper_scissors
   ```

## Usage

Upon running the game, follow these steps:

1. **Select Your Move:**
   - Enter `1` for Rock
   - Enter `2` for Paper
   - Enter `3` for Scissors

2. **AI (Jarvis) Move:**
   The computer will randomly choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissors, and display its choice.

3. **Determine the Winner:**
   - If both the player and Jarvis choose the same move, it's a draw, and the game will prompt you to play again.
   - Otherwise, the game will declare the winner based on the standard rules.

## Example Gameplay

1. The game prompts you to choose your move.
2. You enter your choice (e.g., `1` for Rock).

4. The game declares the outcome:
   - **Draw:** The game asks you to play again.
